|   1 | Duffing                       | Computational agrees with analytical HB     |
|   2 | Single-DOF, unilateral spring | Zeroth and higher harmonics can be relevant |
|   3 | Beam, dry friction            | HB can save a lot of computational effort   |
|   4 | Beam, cubic spring            | Dynamic scaling can be beneficial           |
